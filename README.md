## Introduction
Due to the importance of the JLPT in the current era for non-Japanese citizens who wish to work or study in Japan, the JLPT is held every year. Our group's JLPT Test Taker Database aims to organize data related to JLPT test takers and applicants in a user-friendly and accessible format. Additionally, the data is organized into groups.

## Open Questions for Building the JLPT Database
These questions aim to analyze data related to the JLPT exam:
1. Comparison of Test Takers on January 2, 2022 and December 3, 2022
	* Compare all test takers on January 2, 2022 with all test takers on December 3, 2022.
2. Provinces with the Most Applicants in Each Country
	* Identify the provinces with the most applicants in each country.
3. Top 5 Countries with the Most Test Takers
	* Show the top 5 countries with the most test takers.
4. Comparison of Real Test Taker Percentage in Europe and East Asia
	* Compare the percentage of real test takers in Europe with the percentage of real test takers in East Asia.
5. Profit or Loss of JLPT in Japan
	* Assuming Japan invested 1,000,000,000 yen in the JLPT in 2022, show whether Japan will make a profit or loss if the exams are held on January 2, 2022 and December 3, 2022.
